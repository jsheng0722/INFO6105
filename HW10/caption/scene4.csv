Ryan：“当时因为AI狗故障，需要爸爸修理”
Ryan：“爸爸在修的时候很沉默”
Ryan：“没有放他往常都会放的音乐”
Ryan：“中途他和我开始聊AI狗”
Ryan开始回忆：“他说：AI狗也会生病和死亡，要做好准备”
Ryan：“当时我不想听这些”
Ryan：“我就觉得AI狗好多了，它还新”
Ryan：“我反驳爸爸说他会一直陪着我的”
Ryan：“但爸爸说这一天总会到来的”
Ryan：“他不是一只随便的狗”
Ryan：“他是一只好狗，非常好的那种”
Ryan：“他会预判我的需求和行动，保证我的安全”
Ryan：“他一生都在思考如何让我开心并帮助我”
Ryan：“或许因为总是在照顾别人，他累了”
Ryan：“也或许有一天他会死去”
Ryan：“我还记得爸爸说到了他该离开的时候，他就会离开”
Ryan：“爸爸跟我说我无能为力，虽然会很难过，但并不是无法承受”
Ryan：“爸爸在说他自己，现在，我到最后才知道”

"Ryan: ""At that time, because of a malfunction in the AI dog, Dad needed to repair it."""
"Ryan: ""Dad was silent while fixing it."""
"Ryan: ""He didn't play the music he usually plays."""
"Ryan: ""Midway, he and I started talking about the AI dog."""
"Ryan began to reminisce: ""He said: AI dogs can also get sick and die, be prepared."""
"Ryan: ""At that time, I didn't want to hear these things."""
"Ryan: ""I felt the AI dog was fine; it was still new."""
"Ryan: ""I argued with Dad that he would always be with me."""
"Ryan: ""But Dad said that day would come."""
"Ryan: ""He's not just any dog."""
"Ryan: ""He's a good dog, a very good one."""
"Ryan: ""He can anticipate my needs and actions, ensuring my safety."""
"Ryan: ""Throughout his life, he's been thinking about how to make me happy and help me."""
"Ryan: ""Perhaps because he's always taking care of others, he's tired."""
"Ryan: ""Or perhaps, one day, he will pass away."""
"Ryan: ""I still remember Dad saying that when the time comes for him to leave, he will leave."""
"Ryan: ""Dad told me I couldn't do anything about it, even though it would be hard, but not unbearable."""
"Ryan: ""Dad was talking about himself, and now, I only know it at the end."""
